## Automate the creation of Python projects

[2022-04-14] I wanted to create a python project, but didn't find what I want. It's really weird that we need to take so much time preparing a project, rather than coding. So...

![Thanos decides to do it himself]()

### I'll do it my self

I decided to create a tool to automate the creation of Python üêç projects, with five requirements in mind:

1. 100% Open Source
2. 100% Python-based using Pypi libraries
3. Easy to configure by using config files
4. Independent from third party tools or dependencies (let's see about that üòÖ)
5. Batteries included (which means to include an install script and a dummy running project to learn to use the tool)

### üíª TODOs

- Create a dummy python project for testing
- Add `try/excepts`
- Create tests
- Add `argparse` for CLI options
- Add templates for licenses
- Add template for `requirements.txt`
- Add option for JSON and YAML structure files
- Add code coverage with Coverage.py
- Add code styling with Black
- Add testing with Pytest
- Add static code analysis with Mypy or Pyre (idk which one yet)
- Create Makefile
- Add Git integration for `.git` folder and hooks
- Add automatic code-document generation
- and more...
