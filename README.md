Automate the creation of Python projects

### 2022-04-14

I decided to create a tool for the inception of Python 🐍 projects with five requirements in mind:
1. 100% Open Source
2. 100% Python-based using Pypi libraries
3. Easy to configure by using config files
4. Independent from third party tools or dependencies (let's see about that 😅)
5. Batteries included (which means to include an install script and a dummy running project to learn to use the tool)

##  💻 TODOs 

- Create a dummy python project for testing
- Add `try/excepts`
- Create tests
- Add `argparse` for CLI options
- Add templates for licenses
- Add template for `requirements.txt`
- Add option for JSON and YAML structure files
- Add code coverage with Coverage.py
- Add code styling with Black
- Add testing with Pytest
- Add static code analysis with Mypy or Pyre (idk which one yet)
- Create Makefile
- Add Git integration for `.git` folder and hooks
- Add automatic code-document generation
- and more...
