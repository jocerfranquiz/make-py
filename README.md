## Automate the creation of Python projects

A really simple tool for **automation** of the creation of Python 🐍 projects. The project has this five requirements:

1. 100% Open Source
2. 100% Python-based using Pypi libraries
3. Easy to configure by using config files
4. Independent from third party tools or dependencies (let's see about that 😅)
5. Batteries included (which means to include an install script and a dummy running project to learn to use the tool)

## 💻 TODOs

- [ ] Create a dummy python project for testing
- [ ] Add `try/excepts`
- [ ] Create tests
- [ ] Add `argparse` for CLI options
- [ ] Add templates for licenses
- [ ] Add template for `requirements.txt`
- [ ] Add option for JSON and YAML structure files
- [ ] Add code coverage with Coverage.py
- [ ] Add code styling with Black
- [ ] Add testing with Pytest
- [ ] Add static code analysis with Mypy or Pyre (idk which one yet)
- [ ] Create Makefile
- [ ] Add Git integration for `.git` folder and hooks
- [ ] Add automatic code-document generation
